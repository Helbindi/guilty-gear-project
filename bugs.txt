Bug: When you swap between Moves(Standing -> Forward),
    the State of Inputs remain the same. Thus, if you
    leave an Active State larger than the follow Move.
    The App will crash.

Example: Click HS or D Image for Standing, and swap to Forward.
        HS and D have State 3 / State 4, while Forward only has
        3 Images, thus only has a max State of 2. When attempting
        to swap, it tries to look for a video of using State 3 or 4.
        
Attempt: Try to reset the State to 0 when you swap from Standing to Forward.
